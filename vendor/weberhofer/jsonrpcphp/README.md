JSON-RPC PHP
============

JSON-RPC PHP is a couple of classes written in PHP implementing respectively
client and server functionalities of the JSON-RPC protocol.

This software has originally been developed at http://jsonrpcphp.org/ and has
been modified to support newer PHP versions and name-spaces; some bugs have
been fixed.
